      <description>TL:DR This post covers Bayesian A/B Testing, an alternative solution to designing cost-efficient experiments while preserving strength of evidence. To demonstrate and explain the basic concept, readers are referred to the brief introduction and simple implementation (Jupyter Notebook) further down below. Feel free to play around with the actual thing following the link here.
Introduction A/B testing has become a cornerstone in the digital age for identifying and measuring causal effects.</description>

      <title>Econometric Panel Data Modelling: Albert Heijn (Ahold Delhaize)</title>

      <description>TL:DR In collaboration with Albert Heijn, this study explores the dynamics between product labels and consumer buying behaviour. The study successfully addressed the challenges posed by panel data, such as unobserved heterogeneity, omitted variable bias, and seasonality, demonstrating the usefulness of the micro-econometric toolkit.
The positive reception of the findings and methodologies led to an invitation to present the results at Albert Heijn&amp;rsquo;s Data Science department&amp;rsquo;s Knowledge Exchange initiative. The main contribution of the study is the proof-of-concept and simplifiction of micro-econometric methods for these specific use-cases.</description>

      <title>Uplift Modelling: Personalising Discount Campaigns</title>

      <description>TL:DR This post cover an application of Uplift modelling, a methodology that leverages causal inference insights alongside personalisation techniques (XGBoost) to optimise ROI on, in this case, an A/B/n tested marketing campaign. The experiment results can be used to identify target audience to maximise positive conversion and to minimise corresponding costs and campaign-caused churns.
Context When considering targeted campaigns one of the most important questions to ask is, Who is our intended audience?</description>
