      <description>TL:DR This post contains a brief introduction to deep-learning based reinforcement learning in the form of simple/standard REINFORCE, Actor-Critic (A2C) and Deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithms with a few extensions. When tackling the CartPole-v1 problem, an open-source playground example by OpenAI, we compare the models in terms of game performance, stability and compute. The code was written using Python with PyTorch.
Introduction: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning strategy where an agent learns decision-making skills by moving from state to state by interacting with an closed environment without relying on any data.</description>
