      <description>TL:DR This post covers Bayesian A/B Testing, an alternative solution to designing cost-efficient experiments while preserving strength of evidence. To demonstrate and explain the basic concept, readers are referred to the brief introduction and simple implementation (Jupyter Notebook) further down below. Feel free to play around with the actual thing following the link here.
Introduction A/B testing has become a cornerstone in the digital age for identifying and measuring causal effects.</description>

      <description>TL:DR This post cover an application of Uplift modelling, a methodology that leverages causal inference insights alongside personalisation techniques (XGBoost) to optimise ROI on, in this case, an A/B/n tested marketing campaign. The experiment results can be used to identify target audience to maximise positive conversion and to minimise corresponding costs and campaign-caused churns.
Context When considering targeted campaigns one of the most important questions to ask is, Who is our intended audience?</description>
