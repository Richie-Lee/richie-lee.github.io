      <description>TL:DR The objective of this study is to predict Dutch House prices using macroeconomic variables that were collected from Government open-source databases. Given the high number of explanatory variables relative to the number of observations, we recognise a good fit with parsimonious modelling. These models are characterised by their great explanatory power from minimal resources and are especially valuable in cases of limited or low-frequency data.
The methods considered follow Kim &amp;amp; Swanson (2018) hybrid model design, where we combine factor modelling techniques (PCA, ICA, Sparse PCA) and machine learning ensembles (Boosting) and regularization methods (Elastic Net, Ridge regression, LASSO).</description>

      <description>TL:DR The objective is to accurately identify whether a movie was positively or negatively received through text reviews from IMDb. This is a common NLP challenge that is known as Sentiment Classification. The proposed algorithm is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Especially the ability to capture complex relations and sequential dependencies in text data is what becomes valuable here. In this brief post, a well-known RNN implementation, a LSTM, is benchmarked against other deep learning implementations and checked for robustness.</description>
