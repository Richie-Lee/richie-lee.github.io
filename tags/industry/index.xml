      <description>Introduction A/B testing has become a cornerstone in the digital age for identifying and measuring causal effects. It has emerged as the gold standard in the realm of statistical theory, enabling researchers to make data-driven decisions with strong evidence. A/B tests, also known as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), are observational studies that divide a target sample into two groups: a control group and a treatment group. By introducing an intervention, such as a new user feature, promotion, or policy, to the treatment group, researchers can isolate the treatment effect and analyse its impact.</description>

      <title>Modelling Unobserved Heterogeneity: Albert Heijn (Ahold Delhaize)</title>

      <description>TL:DR In collaboration with Albert Heijn, this study explores the dynamics between product labels and consumer buying behaviour. The study successfully addressed the challenges posed by panel data, such as unobserved heterogeneity, omitted variable bias, and seasonality, demonstrating the usefulness of the micro-econometric toolkit.
The positive reception of the findings and methodologies led to an invitation to present the results at Albert Heijn&amp;rsquo;s Data Science department&amp;rsquo;s Knowledge Exchange initiative.
Context In the competitive landscape of the supermarket industry, understanding consumer behaviour is crucial for Dutch market leader Albert Heijn (Ahold Delhaize) in developing effective strategies to improve revenue and profitability.</description>
