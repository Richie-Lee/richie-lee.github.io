      <description>TL:DR The objective is to accurately identify whether a movie was positively or negatively received through text reviews from IMDb. This is a common NLP challenge that is known as Sentiment Classification. The proposed algorithm is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Especially the ability to capture complex relations and sequential dependencies in text data is what becomes valuable here. In this brief post, a well-known RNN implementation, a LSTM, is benchmarked against other deep learning implementations and checked for robustness.</description>
