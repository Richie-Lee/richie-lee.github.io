      <description>Introduction A/B testing has become a cornerstone in the digital age for identifying and measuring causal effects. It has emerged as the gold standard in the realm of statistical theory, enabling researchers to make data-driven decisions with strong evidence. A/B tests, also known as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), are observational studies that divide a target sample into two groups: a control group and a treatment group. By introducing an intervention, such as a new user feature, promotion, or policy, to the treatment group, researchers can isolate the treatment effect and analyse its impact.</description>
