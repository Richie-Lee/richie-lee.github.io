      <description>TL:DR This post covers Bayesian A/B Testing, an alternative solution to designing cost-efficient experiments while preserving strength of evidence. To demonstrate and explain the basic concept, readers are referred to the brief introduction and simple implementation (Jupyter Notebook) further down below. Feel free to play around with the actual thing following the link here.
Introduction A/B testing has become a cornerstone in the digital age for identifying and measuring causal effects.</description>

      <description>TL:DR This article explore the development of a scalable product duplicate detection framework for E-commerce data. Our approach involves combining clustering (Locality-Sensitive Hashing - LSH) with classification, supported by thorough data preprocessing using text analysis and NLP techniques.
The overall approach is summarised in the following diagram: Context With the ever increasing relevance of online shopping and customers are becoming more comfortable with online platforms with user experience therefore playing a crucial role in driving sales and preventing churn.</description>

      <description>TL:DR The objective is to accurately identify whether a movie was positively or negatively received through text reviews from IMDb. This is a common NLP challenge that is known as Sentiment Classification. The proposed algorithm is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Especially the ability to capture complex relations and sequential dependencies in text data is what becomes valuable here. In this brief post, a well-known RNN implementation, a LSTM, is benchmarked against other deep learning implementations and checked for robustness.</description>
