      <description>Introduction A/B testing has become a cornerstone in the digital age for identifying and measuring causal effects. It has emerged as the gold standard in the realm of statistical theory, enabling researchers to make data-driven decisions with strong evidence. A/B tests, also known as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), are observational studies that divide a target sample into two groups: a control group and a treatment group. By introducing an intervention, such as a new user feature, promotion, or policy, to the treatment group, researchers can isolate the treatment effect and analyse its impact.</description>

      <description>TL:DR This article explore the development of a scalable product duplicate detection framework for E-commerce data. Our approach involves combining clustering (Locality-Sensitive Hashing - LSH) with classification, supported by thorough data preprocessing using text analysis and NLP techniques.
The overall approach is summarised in the following diagram: [insert big overview]
Context With the ever increasing relevance of online shopping and customers are becoming more comfortable with online platforms with user experience therefore playing a crucial role in driving sales and preventing churn.</description>

      <description>Context The objective is to accurately identify whether a movie was positively or negatively received through text reviews from IMDb. This is a process that is often referred to as Sentiment Classification. Though seemingly trivial, there were multiple aspects that made this problem more challenging:
Input data size is not consistent (different review lengths) Small differences are often relevant, ruling out standard similarity methods There are a lot of distinct dependencies across words Time constraints: 1 week for coding &amp;amp; reporting Data Amazons IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is known as the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular source for movie reviews.</description>
