      <description>TL:DR This post covers Bayesian A/B Testing, an alternative solution to designing cost-efficient experiments while preserving strength of evidence. To demonstrate and explain the basic concept, readers are referred to the brief introduction and simple implementation (Jupyter Notebook) further down below. Feel free to play around with the actual thing following the link here.
Introduction A/B testing has become a cornerstone in the digital age for identifying and measuring causal effects.</description>

      <title>Econometric Panel Data Modelling: Albert Heijn (Ahold Delhaize)</title>

      <description>TL:DR In collaboration with Albert Heijn, this study explores the dynamics between product labels and consumer buying behaviour. The study successfully addressed the challenges posed by panel data, such as unobserved heterogeneity, omitted variable bias, and seasonality, demonstrating the usefulness of the micro-econometric toolkit.
The positive reception of the findings and methodologies led to an invitation to present the results at Albert Heijn&amp;rsquo;s Data Science department&amp;rsquo;s Knowledge Exchange initiative. The main contribution of the study is the proof-of-concept and simplifiction of micro-econometric methods for these specific use-cases.</description>

      <description>TL:DR This article explore the development of a scalable product duplicate detection framework for E-commerce data. Our approach involves combining clustering (Locality-Sensitive Hashing - LSH) with classification, supported by thorough data preprocessing using text analysis and NLP techniques.
The overall approach is summarised in the following diagram: Context With the ever increasing relevance of online shopping and customers are becoming more comfortable with online platforms with user experience therefore playing a crucial role in driving sales and preventing churn.</description>

      <title>PCA Machine Learning Hybrid Models: Real Estate Forecasting</title>

      <description>TL:DR The objective of this study is to predict Dutch House prices using macroeconomic variables that were collected from Government open-source databases. Given the high number of explanatory variables relative to the number of observations, we recognise a good fit with parsimonious modelling. These models are characterised by their great explanatory power from minimal resources and are especially valuable in cases of limited or low-frequency data.
The methods considered follow Kim &amp;amp; Swanson (2018) hybrid model design, where we combine factor modelling techniques (PCA, ICA, Sparse PCA) and machine learning ensembles (Boosting) and regularization methods (Elastic Net, Ridge regression, LASSO).</description>

      <description>TL:DR This post contains a brief introduction to deep-learning based reinforcement learning in the form of simple/standard REINFORCE, Actor-Critic (A2C) and Deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithms with a few extensions. When tackling the CartPole-v1 problem, an open-source playground example by OpenAI, we compare the models in terms of game performance, stability and compute. The code was written using Python with PyTorch.
Introduction: Reinforcement Learning (RL) Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning strategy where an agent learns decision-making skills by moving from state to state by interacting with an closed environment without relying on any data.</description>

      <description>TL:DR The objective is to accurately identify whether a movie was positively or negatively received through text reviews from IMDb. This is a common NLP challenge that is known as Sentiment Classification. The proposed algorithm is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Especially the ability to capture complex relations and sequential dependencies in text data is what becomes valuable here. In this brief post, a well-known RNN implementation, a LSTM, is benchmarked against other deep learning implementations and checked for robustness.</description>
