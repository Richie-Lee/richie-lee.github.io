It has emerged as the gold standard in the realm of statistical theory, enabling researchers to make data-driven decisions with strong evidence. A/B tests, also known as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), are observational studies that divide a target sample into two groups: a control group and a treatment group. By introducing an intervention, such as a new user feature, promotion, or policy, to the treatment group, researchers can isolate the treatment effect and analyse its impact.","tags":["Econometrics","Industry","Bayesian Statistics","Classification"],"title":"Bayesian A/B Testing: JustEatTakeaway.com [MSc Thesis - WIP]","type":"post","url":"/post/2023_bayesian_ab_testing_jet/","weight":0,"wordcount":505},{"author":null,"categories":["Projects"],"content":"In collaboration with Albert Heijn (Supermarket), this study explores the dynamics between product labels and consumer buying behaviour.
